Privacy Policy for my Alexa Skill – Code Counter	
Amazon Alexa Privacy Policy
What information does the skill collect?

We collect your Amazon ID so that we know when you visit the skill again. This is not your email or any personal ID. It is a unique ID that Amazon generates and can’t be used to identify you in any way.

The ID looks like this:

amzn1.ask.account.AHAS… and another 200+ random characters

How do we protect your information

Information is not personally identifiable – that means even if someone compromised our server, the information is useless.

We also ensure only Amazon can make calls into our services. Our services are secured with long passwords and non-default accounts.

Do we disclose any information to 3rd parties

No and we have no intention to. This is a hobby.

If you have any questions I’ll happily answer them.
