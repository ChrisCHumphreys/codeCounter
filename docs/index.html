<p>Privacy Policy for my Alexa Skill – Code Counter</p>	
<p>Amazon Alexa Privacy Policy</p>
<p>What information does the skill collect?</p>
<br>
<p>We collect your Amazon ID so that we know when you visit the skill again. This is not your email or any personal ID. It is a unique ID that Amazon generates and can’t be used to identify you in any way.</p>
<br>
<p>The ID looks like this:</p>
<br>
<p>amzn1.ask.account.AHAS… and another 200+ random characters</p>
<br>
<p>How do we protect your information</p>
<br>
<p>Information is not personally identifiable – that means even if someone compromised our server, the information is useless.</p>
<br>
<p>We also ensure only Amazon can make calls into our services. Our services are secured with long passwords and non-default accounts.</p>
<br>
<p>Do we disclose any information to 3rd parties</p>
<br>
<p>No and we have no intention to. This is a hobby.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>If you have any questions I’ll happily answer them.</p>
